# Task Manager :white_check_mark:

This is a simple **Task Manager** that I built to experiment with some very interesting concepts using **Node.js** and **React.js**.

It gives the possibility to add and delete tasks an create a **to-do list**.

## Built with

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/)
* [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/)
